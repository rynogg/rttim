Ryno's Toontown Infinite Modifications
================

Hi.  This is my really old Toontown codebase that I got into game programming with, based on a really old version of Toontown Infinite from around 2014-2015.  If you have any sort of respect, please look into Open Toontown for an open source Toontown instead of this.

If you REALLY want to try this out, then you'll need to track down an old version of Panda3D 1.9.0 that was specialized for Toontown Infinite.  You can probably find it from old tutorials from the time.
